# Introduction
## What Exactly is R?
* A free programming language and software environment for statistical computing including data analysis and modelling. 
* Follows and supports the open-source ideal, R is released under the GNU license.
* The R source code is written primarily in C, Fortran, and R.
* Easy to learn and powerful (extensibility).
* Professional graphics, ideal for scientific publications.
* Compatible with all popular operating systems: Windows,
Mac OS, Linux.
* Is always up to date and is continuously being developed.
* Compatible with Fortran, C und LAT<sub>E</sub>X.
* Better possibilities for archiving analysis and modelling
protocols.
* Has become a standard in plant sciences.
* Good for communicating methods with research partners.
* Increasingly scientific journals encourage/demand the publication of R code. 
* Many textbooks use R code for illustration and dissemination, e.g. [useR! series in Springer](http://www.springer.com/series/6991).

## History
* R is an implementation of the S programming language created by John Chambers in 1976.
* R was created by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman at the University of Auckland, New Zealand.
* R is named partly after the first names of the first two R authors and partly as a play on the name of S. 
* The project was conceived in 1992, with an initial version released in 1995 and a stable beta version in 2000.


## How to Get R?
* Select the “Cran Mirror” for the country of current
residence (e.g. http://ftp.acc.umu.se/mirror/CRAN/).
* Click on the download link for your operating system.
* Click on the subfolder “base”.
* Click on the download link and launch the installation
program.

## Editors, Integrated Programming Environments
* Theoretically R code can be written in any editor and then committed via a commnd line interface.
* R has a very basic graphical user interface, i.e. the R GUI, which starts automatically when you click on the R icon.
* For comfortable use, we recommend RStudio.
