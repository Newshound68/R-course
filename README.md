# R-course
This repository includes material supporting a short course in the statistical software R

R is a programming language and software environment for carrying out computations, manipulating and analysing data and creating various types of high-quality graphs among other things. Over the past five years R has become a standard in plant sciences and a good knowledge of this software/language can be recommended to everybody. The aim of this short course is to introduce the necessary basics to beginners. We will cover basic data structures and functions for computations and data manipulation. We will also show how to import and export data files, visualising data and obtaining summary statistics.
