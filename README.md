# R-course
This repository includes material supporting a short course in the statistical software R.

R is a programming language and software environment for carrying out computations, manipulating and analysing data and creating various types of high-quality graphs among other things. Over the past five years R has become a standard in plant sciences and a good knowledge of this software/language can be recommended to everybody. The aim of this short course is to introduce the necessary basics to beginners. We will cover basic data structures and functions for computations and data manipulation. We will also show how to import and export data files, visualising data and obtaining summary statistics.

How to work with the files in this repository?
Start reading the markdown file Rintro.md for a general introduction. We recommend using the front end RStudio. First you have to install R and then you can download RStudio from [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).

Next download the the R files Basics.R, DataFrames.R, InputOutput.R, GraphsRegression.R, FunctionsFlowControl.R, ExtendingRwithC.R and open them as R scripts in RStudio. Work through these scripts line by line in this order. The pdf file RguideAp2017.pdf will guide you in this process. 

Enjoy and have fun!
